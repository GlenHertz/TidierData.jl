        "[![Build Status](https://github.com/kdpsingh/Tidier.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/kdpsingh/Tidier.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)\n",

        "## What is Tidier.jl?\n",
        "\n",
        "Tidier.jl is a 100% Julia implementation of the R tidyverse mini-language in Julia. Powered by the DataFrames.jl package and Julia's extensive meta-programming capabilities, Tidier.jl is an R user's love letter to data analysis in Julia.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tidier.jl has two goals, which differentiate it from other data analysis meta-packages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stick as closely to tidyverse syntax as possible:** Whereas other meta-packages introduce Julia-centric idioms for working with DataFrames, this package's goal is to reimplement parts of tidyverse in Julia.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Make broadcasting mostly invisible:** Broadcasting trips up many R users switching to Julia because R users are used to most functions being vectorized. Tidier.jl currently uses a lookup table to decide which functions not to vectorize; all other functions are automatically vectorized. The following functions are treated as non-vectorized: `mean()`, `median()`, `first()`, `last()`, `minimum()`, `maximum()`, `sum()`, and `length()`. Support for `nrow()` and `proprow()` will be coming soon, and users may eventually be given the option to override these defaults.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What functions does Tidier.jl support?\n",
        "\n",
        "To support R-style programming, Tidier.jl is implemented using macros.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tidier.jl currently supports the following macros:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `@select()`\n",
        "- `@transmute()` (which is just an alias for `@select()` because they share the backend implementation in DataFrames.jl)\n",
        "- `@rename()`\n",
        "- `@mutate()`\n",
        "- `@summarize()` and `@summarise()`\n",
        "- `@filter()`\n",
        "- `@group_by()`\n",
        "\n",
        "## What's missing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Helper selector functions like `starts_with()` aren't implemented yet. The `across()` function isn't implemented yet but will be relatively straightforward to implement.\n",
